 This lab, as the title of it states, represents how to run code onto displays. Part A we
 setup and designed a character alphabet to display on the PCD8544 via SPI in order to write
 functions for communicating with the screen. Part B was displaying code on the 1602 LCD
 via I2C. Part 3 was taking those parts and running with it to create an animation on the
 PCD8544 or using the keypad to upload characters to the LCD 1602.
